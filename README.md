# Free Space Optical Communications on Arduino

**Description:**

This project explores the fascinating world of free space optical (FSO) communications using the Arduino platform. FSO technology enables wireless data transmission using light, offering a high-speed and secure alternative to traditional radio frequency communication.

This repository contains Arduino sketches, circuit diagrams, and documentation detailing the implementation of a basic FSO communication system. The project demonstrates the following:

* **Transmitter:** Arduino-controlled laser diode for transmitting data encoded as light pulses.
* **Receiver:** Arduino-based photodiode or phototransistor circuit for detecting and decoding the received light signals.
* **Modulation:** Implementation of basic modulation schemes (e.g., On-Off Keying) for encoding data into light pulses.
* **Error Detection/Correction:** Implementation of error detection and correction techniques to ensure reliable data transmission.

**Components:**

* Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
* LED or laser diode (transmitter)
* Photodiode or phototransistor (receiver)
* Resistors (for circuit design)
* Breadboard or PCB (for building the circuit)
* (Optional) Lenses, collimators (for focusing the light beam)

**Goals:**

* Gain hands-on experience with FSO communication principles and implementation.
* Explore the potential of FSO technology for various applications.
* Experiment with different modulation and error correction techniques.

**Future Development:**

* Implement more advanced modulation schemes (e.g., Pulse Position Modulation).
* Investigate the use of lasers for higher data rates and longer distances.
* Explore the integration of FSO with other wireless technologies.

**Contributions:**

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to share your ideas, suggestions, or improvements.
